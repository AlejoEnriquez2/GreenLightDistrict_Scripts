## Abstract
**Context.** Electron-based desktop applications such as Skype Discord, and Slack have become integral tools for remote communication and collaboration. They offer distinctive advantages over their web-based counterparts, notably in their ability to access native system functionalities. Simultaneously, with the rising prominence of these platforms, it has become imperative to assess their energy and performance profiles.

**Goal.** The primary objective of this research is to critically assess Electron-based applications like Skype, Discord, and Slack against their web-based equivalents. This evaluation aims to quantify aspects related to energy efficiency and computational demands i.e. performance, providing end-users and organizations with data-driven insights to make more energy-conscious software choices.

**Method.** An exhaustive multi-factor and multi-treatment experimental design was employed. This structure encompasses a total of 48 unique scenarios, accounting for platform types, modes of interaction, and interaction durations. The collected empirical data from these runs serves as the foundation for our comprehensive analysis, aiming to validate the posed hypotheses about energy consumption and operational performance across different communication platforms.
